# login-page
Hi 👋 I'm Mohamed 👨‍💻
I created this page to log users into my personal website [@personal website](https://code-mo-dev.github.io/Portfolio/)

# How to use

# Technologies that were used

## UI / UX Design
- I used a background from Wallpapers.

## Software technologies 

As usual I used `HTML` to build the basic structure of the project. <br>

I also used `Css` to add the background to the site and to make the form (input) elements responsive to all screen sizes. <br>

I also used the `Font Awesome` library to add icons to represent each input element.<br>

I've also added some `JavaScript` code that organizes the role of the `email.js` library in the `backend` of the site.<br>

## features 

📱 Responsive design for all screens. <br>
⚡ Fast loading and smooth user experience. <br>
🔒 Secure transmission of user data. <br> 
🎨 Simple and beautiful design for the face. <br>
⚖️ A special page explaining the rights and conditions that must be known before registering.
